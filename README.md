Wallpaper Changer

A Python-based application to dynamically fetch and set wallpapers for multi-monitor setups. The script fetches random images for each monitor, creates a composite wallpaper that spans all screens (including portrait and landscape orientations), and updates your desktop background automatically.
Features

    Dynamic Multi-Monitor Support:
        Detects monitor resolutions and orientations (landscape or portrait).
        Creates a composite wallpaper that aligns perfectly across all displays.

    Random Wallpapers:
        Fetches images locally preventing duplicates.

    Automated Execution:
        Can be scheduled to run at startup and every 30 minutes using Task Scheduler.

Requirements

    Operating System: Windows 10 or later.
    Python: Version 3.6 or higher.
    Python Libraries:
        requests
        Pillow

Install required libraries:

```pip install requests pillow```

or if windows

```py -m pip install requests pillow```

How It Works

    Detects all connected monitors and their resolutions.
    Fetches random images sized to fit each monitor.
    Combines these images into a composite wallpaper spanning all monitors.
    Updates the desktop background automatically.

Installation

Clone the repository:

```
git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/wallpaper-changer.git
cd wallpaper-changer
```

Usage

Run Manually

Execute the script directly:

```
python wallpaper_changer.py
```

or if windows 

```
py wallpaper_changer.py
```


Automate with Task Scheduler


To run the script every 30 minutes and at startup:

Create a .bat file to execute the script:

@echo off
python "C:\path\to\wallpaper_changer.py"
or
py "C:\path\to\wallpaper_changer.py"

Add the .bat file to Windows Task Scheduler:
    Set triggers for on login and repeat 30-minutes indefinitely.
    Use the "Run only when user is logged on" option.

Customization

Change Image Source:
    Modify the fetch_image_from_web function to use a different image source (e.g., Wikimedia Commons, Unsplash, or a local folder).
Adjust Execution Interval:
    Change the interval in Task Scheduler to your preferred frequency.

Troubleshooting

Wallpaper Not Aligning:
    Ensure your display settings are set to "Span" under Background options.
    Verify monitor resolutions in the get_display_info() output.

Task Scheduler Issues:
    Use the "Run only when user is logged on" setting if you donâ€™t have a password.
